      {
        question: 'How do QR magnets work?',
        answer: 'Each UpkeepQR magnet contains a unique QR code that links to a personalized maintenance dashboard for your home. Simply scan the code with your phone camera, complete a quick 60-second setup about your home\'s details, and we\'ll automatically send you reminders for maintenance tasks like changing AC filters, checking smoke alarms, and seasonal home care.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens when I scan the magnet?',
        answer: 'When you scan the QR code, you\'ll be taken to a mobile-friendly setup page where you\'ll answer questions about your home (HVAC system, square footage, etc.). Based on your responses, we create a customized maintenance schedule and start sending you timely reminders via email, calendar invites, or optional SMS notifications.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is my data safe and private?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! We take your privacy seriously. We only collect the information necessary to send you maintenance reminders (like your HVAC system type and preferred contact method). We never sell your data, and you can update your preferences or delete your account at any time. All data is encrypted and stored securely.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the cost of requesting a professional?',
        answer: 'The "Request a Pro" service is completely free! We connect you with qualified local professionals in your area. You only pay the contractor directly for their services. We pre-screen all professionals in our network to ensure they\'re licensed, insured, and have good customer reviews.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I list my property on UpkeepQR?',
        answer: 'Use our Fee Listing form to submit your property details. Each listed property gets its own UpkeepQR magnet, which helps future owners or tenants easily access maintenance schedules and local service providers. This is especially valuable for real estate agents looking to add value for their clients.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I customize my maintenance schedule?',
        answer: 'Yes! After your initial setup, you can log into your account to adjust reminder frequencies, add custom maintenance tasks, or turn off reminders for tasks you handle differently. The system learns from your preferences to provide more personalized recommendations over time.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if I move to a new home?',
        answer: 'Your UpkeepQR account travels with you! When you move, you can update your home details in your account settings. If you leave the magnet behind for the new owners, they can scan it to set up their own maintenance schedule. You can also order a new magnet for your new home at a discount.'
