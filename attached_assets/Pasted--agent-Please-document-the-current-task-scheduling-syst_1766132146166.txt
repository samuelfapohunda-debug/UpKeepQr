@agent Please document the current task scheduling system in UpKeepQr application. Create comprehensive documentation showing the end-to-end flow.

OBJECTIVE:
Document how the maintenance task scheduling system currently works in the UpKeepQr application, from task creation to completion tracking.

SCOPE:
Analyze and document the complete flow of:
1. How maintenance tasks are created and stored
2. How tasks are assigned to households/appliances
3. How scheduling and reminders work
4. How task completion is tracked
5. Database schema related to tasks
6. API endpoints for task management
7. Frontend components that display/manage tasks
8. Any automation or background jobs

FILES TO ANALYZE:

**Backend:**
- `server/src/routes/*.ts` - Look for task-related routes
- `shared/schema.ts` - Find task-related tables (maintenance_logs, household_task_assignments, home_maintenance_tasks, etc.)
- `server/db.ts` - Database connection and queries
- Any cron jobs or scheduled processes

**Frontend:**
- `client/src/pages/*.tsx` - Look for task management pages
- `client/src/components/*.tsx` - Task-related components
- Any calendar integration code

**Database Tables to Document:**
- `home_maintenance_tasks` - Task definitions
- `household_task_assignments` - Task assignments to households
- `maintenance_logs` - Completed task records
- `common_appliances` - Appliance types with maintenance needs
- `household_appliances` - Specific appliances in households
- Any other related tables

DELIVERABLE FORMAT:
Create a Markdown document: `TASK_SCHEDULING_SYSTEM.md` with:

1. **System Overview**
   - High-level description of task scheduling functionality
   - Key features available

2. **Database Schema**
   ```
   Tables and relationships:
   - Table name
   - Key fields
   - Relationships to other tables
   - Sample data structure
   ```

3. **Data Flow Diagrams**
   ```
   Task Creation Flow:
   [User Action] → [API Endpoint] → [Database] → [Response]
   
   Task Assignment Flow:
   [Household] → [Appliance] → [Task Template] → [Scheduled Task]
   
   Task Completion Flow:
   [User Marks Complete] → [Update DB] → [Log Entry] → [Notification?]
   ```

4. **API Endpoints**
   ```
   List all task-related endpoints:
   - Method: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
   - Path: /api/...
   - Purpose: What it does
   - Request body: Expected input
   - Response: What it returns
   ```

5. **Frontend Components**
   ```
   List components that interact with tasks:
   - Component name and file location
   - What it displays
   - What actions it supports
   - Props it accepts
   ```

6. **Current Limitations**
   - What's NOT implemented yet
   - What doesn't work as expected
   - Missing features

7. **Code Examples**
   - Sample API call
   - Sample database query
   - Sample component usage

COMMANDS TO RUN:
```bash
# Find task-related files
find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l "task\|maintenance\|schedule" | grep -v node_modules

# Check database schema
grep -A20 "maintenance\|task" shared/schema.ts

# Find API routes
grep -r "router\." server/src/routes/ | grep -i "task\|maintenance"

# Find frontend components
find client/src -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l -i "task\|maintenance\|schedule"
```

START ANALYSIS:
Begin by examining the database schema, then trace through the API routes, and finally document the frontend implementation. Show the complete end-to-end flow with specific file references and code snippets.

Create the documentation file at: `docs/TASK_SCHEDULING_SYSTEM.md`

If docs folder doesn't exist, create it first.
