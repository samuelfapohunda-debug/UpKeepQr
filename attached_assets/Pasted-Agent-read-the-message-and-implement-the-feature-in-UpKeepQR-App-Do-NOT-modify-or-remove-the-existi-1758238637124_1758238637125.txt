Agent, read the message and implement the feature in UpKeepQR App
Do NOT modify or remove the existing “Request a Pro” or “Order Magnet” dashboards. Create a new module and admin area for Flat-Fee MLS listings.
Context & Goals
We’re a licensed broker able to list in multiple US states. Build a “Flat-Fee MLS” service similar in spirit to Homecoin: a low upfront fee to publish a property to the MLS, plus optional add-ons (e.g., listing help, showing management routing, yard sign/post, etc.). No hidden closing fees; price varies by MLS/market. (homecoin.com)
What we’re mirroring (for reference)
Base flat-fee MLS listing (advertised at $95 by Homecoin; our price is configurable per MLS). (homecoin.com)


A-la-carte add-ons, such as “listing help” tiers, showing management routing to the seller, and yard sign/post options. (homecoin.com)


Local pricing pages vary by location/MLS; we need per-MLS pricing/config. (homecoin.com)


Flexible listing period (1–12 months), free cancellation (before offer acceptance), and content/DOM rules guardrails. (support.homecoin.com)



High-Level Scope
Seller Flow (Public)


Landing: “Flat-Fee MLS” explainer with plan cards and add-ons.


Address & MLS detection (ZIP → map to MLS configuration).


Eligibility check (property type, seller attestation they’re the owner, fair-housing + brokerage disclosures).


Plan & add-on selection (configurable per MLS).


Account creation (email + OTP) or continue as returning user.


Property intake (all core MLS fields + photos/docs):


Basics: property type, beds/baths, square footage, lot size, year built.


Pricing & terms: list price, concessions, buyer-agent commission %.


Public remarks / private agent remarks (validate against MLS content rules). (support.homecoin.com)


Showing instructions (route requests directly to seller; support popular platforms). (support.homecoin.com)


Photos (min/max count, formats), virtual tour URL.


Disclosures (upload) + seller contact.


E-sign / upload of required listing agreement (we’ll start with upload of a signed PDF; if ESIGN_PROVIDER is set, allow DocuSign/HelloSign). (Note: listing duration must support 1–12 months.) (support.homecoin.com)


Checkout (Stripe): collect payment for selected plan + add-ons (no closing fee).


Confirmation page with next steps and expected review time.


Admin Flow (Back Office)


New nav entry: Admin → MLS Listings at /admin/mls.


Review queue (status: new, needs_info, approved, submitted_to_mls, live, changes_pending, canceled).


MLS packet builder: human-readable sheet of all fields + photo set + docs for easy copy/paste into the target MLS; export JSON/CSV/ZIP.


Add-on fulfillment:


Showing routing (record which platform is used).


Yard sign/post order coordination and status (installed / removed). (support.homecoin.com)


Listing help tickets (light guidance tier vs. full service notes).


Change orders (price change, description edits, photo swaps) with audit log.


Cancellations (pre-offer) and withdraw guidance; show DOM-reset warning for applicable MLSs. (support.homecoin.com)


Compliance guardrails (content rules, fair-housing links, watermark warnings for stolen media, etc.). (support.homecoin.com)


Email templates (SendGrid): receipt, “submitted to MLS,” “listing live,” change confirmations, cancellation confirmation.


Out of Scope (Phase 1)


Direct RESO/RETS API push into each MLS (Phase 2); for now, generate a clean packet for manual broker submission.


Automated syndication controls beyond what MLS provides.
