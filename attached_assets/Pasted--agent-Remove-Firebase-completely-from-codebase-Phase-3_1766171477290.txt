@agent Remove Firebase completely from codebase - Phase 3 Final Cleanup

OBJECTIVE:
Remove all Firebase code, imports, and dependencies now that migration to PostgreSQL is 100% complete.

CONTEXT:
- Phase 2B complete: All 28 functions migrated to PostgreSQL
- Zero Firebase calls remaining in storage.ts
- Safe to completely remove Firebase

TASKS:

## 1. Delete server/firebase.ts
```bash
rm server/firebase.ts
```

## 2. Remove Firebase imports from server/storage.ts

Find and remove these lines:
```typescript
import { adminDb } from "./firebase";
```

Also remove the COLLECTIONS constant if it exists:
```typescript
const COLLECTIONS = {
  AGENTS: 'agents',
  MAGNETS: 'magnets',
  MAGNET_BATCHES: 'magnetBatches',
  HOUSEHOLDS: 'households',
  TASKS: 'tasks',
  LEADS: 'leads'
};
```

Remove the convertFirestoreData helper method if it exists.

## 3. Remove Firebase from package.json

Remove these dependencies:
```json
"firebase": "^10.12.0",
"firebase-admin": "^12.1.0"
```

## 4. Check for any other Firebase references

Search entire codebase:
```bash
grep -r "firebase\|adminDb\|firestore" server --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
```

If any files are found, remove Firebase imports/usage from them.

## 5. Verify build

After all removals:
```bash
npm install  # Remove unused packages
npm run build  # Should succeed
```

## 6. Update documentation

Create MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md:
```markdown
# Firebase to PostgreSQL Migration - COMPLETE

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Migration Summary
- **Start Date:** December 2024
- **Completion Date:** December 19, 2024
- **Functions Migrated:** 28
- **Tables Created:** 4 new (agents, schedules, task_completions, reminder_queue)
- **Firebase Calls Remaining:** 0

### What Was Migrated
- Phase 1: homeExtra (1 function)
- Phase 2A: Created 4 tables
- Phase 2B Batch 1: agents, schedules, task_completions, reminder_queue (7 functions)
- Phase 2B Batch 2: leads (4 functions)
- Phase 2B Batch 3: events, audit_logs (2 functions)
- Phase 2B Batch 4: magnet_batches (4 functions)
- Phase 2B Batch 5: magnets (5 functions)
- Phase 2B Batch 6: tasks (6 functions)
- Phase 3: Firebase completely removed

### Database Architecture
**Single Database:** PostgreSQL on Neon
**Total Tables:** 26

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ ACID transactions
- ✅ Relational integrity
- ✅ Simpler architecture
- ✅ Cost savings (~$300-600/year)
- ✅ No more data duplication bugs
```

VERIFICATION:
```bash
# Should return empty
grep -r "firebase" server --include="*.ts"

# Should build successfully
npm run build
```
