TASK: Fix MaintCue Logo in Navigation Header

Update the logo in the navigation header to resolve two issues:

ISSUE 1 - Logo Too Small:
- Current logo is too small and hard to see
- Increase logo size to make it more prominent
- Recommended dimensions: 140-160px width (or height: 40-45px)
- Ensure it maintains aspect ratio

ISSUE 2 - Logo Background Color:
- Logo currently has white/light background
- Header background appears to be white/light gray
- Make logo background TRANSPARENT or match header exactly
- Remove any white box/container around the logo

IMPLEMENTATION:

File to update: client/src/components/Navigation.tsx (or Header component)

Changes needed:
1. Increase logo image size:
```tsx
   // Change from something like:
   <img src="/logo.png" className="h-8" />
   
   // To:
   <img src="/logo.png" className="h-10" /> // or h-12 for even larger
   // OR use custom width:
   <img src="/logo.png" style={{ width: '150px' }} />
```

2. Ensure transparent background:
   - If using PNG, verify it has transparent background
   - Remove any wrapper div with background color
   - Remove any padding/background styles on logo container

3. Verify responsive sizing:
   - Logo should scale appropriately on mobile
   - Consider: `className="h-10 md:h-12"` for responsive sizing

SPECIFIC FIXES:

Check these potential issues:
- Remove any `bg-white`, `bg-gray-100`, or similar background classes
- Remove any `rounded` or border styles that create a box
- Ensure logo PNG file itself has transparent background
- If logo has padding, reduce or remove it
- Verify logo aligns vertically with navigation items

VISUAL GOAL:
- Logo should be 2.5-3x current size
- Logo should blend seamlessly with header (no white box)
- Logo should be the primary branding element in header
- Should look professional and prominent

FILES TO CHECK:
- client/src/components/Navigation.tsx
- client/src/components/Header.tsx
- Any global CSS affecting header/logo

After completion, show me:
1. The updated component code
2. Confirm the new logo dimensions
3. Screenshot or description of the visual result
