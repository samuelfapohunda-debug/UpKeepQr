@agent CRITICAL BUG FIX: Fix households data corruption in server/storage.ts

PROBLEM:
Four functions are reading/writing to Firebase instead of PostgreSQL, causing data corruption:
- createHousehold() writes to PostgreSQL ✅
- getHousehold() reads from Firebase ❌ (can't see new households!)
- getHouseholdByToken() reads from Firebase ❌
- getHouseholdsByAgent() reads from Firebase ❌
- updateHousehold() writes to Firebase ❌ (updates lost!)

This means households created after PostgreSQL migration are INVISIBLE to the application!

INSTRUCTIONS:
Follow the exact replacements in HOUSEHOLDS_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md

REQUIRED CHANGES:

**File:** server/storage.ts

**1. Verify imports exist (add if missing):**
```typescript
import { db } from "./db";
import { eq, desc } from "drizzle-orm";
import { householdsTable } from "@shared/schema";
```

**2. Replace getHousehold() - around line 381-384:**
Change Firebase code to:
```typescript
  async getHousehold(id: string): Promise<Household | undefined> {
    const result = await db.query.householdsTable.findFirst({
      where: eq(householdsTable.id, id)
    });
    return result;
  }
```

**3. Replace getHouseholdByToken() - around line 386-393:**
Change to:
```typescript
  async getHouseholdByToken(magnetToken: string): Promise<Household | undefined> {
    const result = await db.query.householdsTable.findFirst({
      where: eq(householdsTable.qrCode, magnetToken)
    });
    return result;
  }
```

**4. Replace getHouseholdsByAgent() - around line 396-403:**
Change to:
```typescript
  async getHouseholdsByAgent(agentId: string): Promise<Household[]> {
    const results = await db.query.householdsTable.findMany({
      where: eq(householdsTable.createdBy, agentId),
      orderBy: desc(householdsTable.createdAt)
    });
    return results;
  }
```

**5. Replace updateHousehold() - around line 572-578:**
Change to:
```typescript
  async updateHousehold(id: string, data: Partial<Household>): Promise<Household | undefined> {
    await db.update(householdsTable)
      .set({
        ...data,
        updatedAt: new Date()
      })
      .where(eq(householdsTable.id, id));
    
    return this.getHousehold(id);
  }
```

**VERIFICATION:**
After making changes:
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Check no Firebase references: `grep "adminDb.*HOUSEHOLDS" server/storage.ts` (should return nothing)
3. Commit: `git add server/storage.ts && git commit -m "fix: Migrate households CRUD from Firebase to PostgreSQL" && git push origin main`

START NOW - This is CRITICAL for data integrity!
