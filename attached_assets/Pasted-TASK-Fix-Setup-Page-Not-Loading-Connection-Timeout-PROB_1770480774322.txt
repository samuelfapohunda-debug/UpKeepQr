TASK: Fix Setup Page Not Loading - Connection Timeout

PROBLEM: When customers click "Activate This QR Code" button in the welcome email, they get ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT at maintcue.com/setup/{activationCode}

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:

1. CHECK SETUP FORM ROUTE
   - File: client/src/App.tsx or router configuration
   - Verify route exists: /setup/:activationCode
   - Check component: SetupForm.tsx or similar
   - Ensure route is properly registered

2. CHECK EMAIL TEMPLATE URL
   - File: server/lib/email.ts
   - Find: sendWelcomeEmail() function
   - Check what URL is being used in "Activate This QR Code" button
   - Current URL: maintcue.com/setup/{code}
   - Problem: maintcue.com is not yet configured as primary domain

3. FIX THE DOMAIN IN EMAIL
   - TEMPORARY FIX: Change URL in email from maintcue.com to upkeepqr.com
   - Find in email template: maintcue.com/setup/
   - Replace with: upkeepqr.com/setup/
   - This will work immediately since upkeepqr.com is live

4. VERIFY SETUP PAGE EXISTS
   - Check: client/src/pages/SetupForm.tsx (or similar)
   - Verify it handles the activation code parameter
   - Test locally: http://localhost:5000/setup/TEST123

5. CHECK DEPLOYMENT
   - Verify setup route is deployed to Render
   - Check Render logs for any route registration messages
   - Confirm frontend build includes setup page

SPECIFIC FIXES:

In email template (server/lib/email.ts):
```typescript
// CHANGE FROM:
const setupUrl = `https://maintcue.com/setup/${activationCode}`;

// CHANGE TO (temporary until maintcue.com DNS is configured):
const setupUrl = `https://upkeepqr.com/setup/${activationCode}`;
```

In router (client/src/App.tsx):
```typescript
// Verify this route exists:
<Route path="/setup/:activationCode" element={<SetupForm />} />
```

SHOW ME:
1. The welcome email template code (where "Activate This QR Code" URL is generated)
2. The current URL being used in the email
3. The router configuration showing /setup route
4. Confirmation that SetupForm component exists

DEPLOY after fixing so the next test order will have working links.
