TASK: Debug and Fix Magnet Order Email Not Sending

PROBLEM: After a successful magnet order is processed, the welcome/confirmation email is not being triggered.

INVESTIGATION STEPS:

1. CHECK STRIPE WEBHOOK HANDLER
   - File: server/src/routes/webhook.ts or server/routes/webhooks.ts
   - Look for: Stripe checkout.session.completed event handler
   - Verify: Email function is being called after successful payment
   - Add logging: console.log('📧 Attempting to send order confirmation email')

2. VERIFY EMAIL FUNCTION IS CALLED
   - Search for: sendWelcomeEmail() or sendOrderConfirmation()
   - Check if it's actually being invoked in webhook handler
   - Look for conditions that might prevent email from sending

3. CHECK FOR ERRORS IN LOGS
   - Search Render logs for:
     * "checkout.session.completed"
     * "email" or "sendgrid"
     * Any error messages during webhook processing
   - Show me any relevant error logs

4. VERIFY WEBHOOK IS RECEIVING DATA
   - Add logging to webhook handler:
```typescript
     console.log('🎯 Webhook received:', event.type);
     console.log('📦 Customer email:', session.customer_details.email);
```

5. CHECK EMAIL TRIGGER LOGIC
   - Verify customer email is being extracted correctly
   - Check if there are any conditional checks preventing email send
   - Look for: if (customerEmail) { sendEmail() }

SPECIFIC AREAS TO CHECK:

In webhook.ts:
- Is sendWelcomeEmail() being called after checkout.session.completed?
- Is the customer email being passed correctly?
- Are there any try-catch blocks silently failing?
- Is the email function awaited properly?

In email service:
- Is SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL set correctly? (should be support@maintcue.com)
- Is the email template correct?
- Any validation that might reject the email?

SHOW ME:
1. The webhook handler code (specifically checkout.session.completed)
2. Where/how the email function is called
3. Any error logs from recent magnet orders
4. The email sending function implementation

Then FIX the issue so emails send after every successful magnet order.
