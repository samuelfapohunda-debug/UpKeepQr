# Home Profile Extra Feature - Integration Guide

## âœ… Installation Complete!

Components have been created. Complete these manual steps:

### 1. Add Component to Setup Page

**File:** `client/src/pages/Setup.tsx` (or similar)

```tsx
import HomeProfileExtraForm from '../components/HomeProfileExtraForm';

// In your component, after the setup form:
{householdId && (
  <HomeProfileExtraForm 
    householdId={householdId}
    onSaveSuccess={() => console.log('Saved!')}
  />
)}
```

### 2. Apply Rate Limiter (if not already done)

**File:** `server/src/routes/homeExtra.ts`

```typescript
router.patch('/:id/extra', homeExtraLimiter, async (req, res) => {
  // your handler
});
```

### 3. Test the Feature

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to setup page
# Expand "More About Your Home" card
# Fill in some fields
# Click Save
# Verify success message
# Refresh page - data should persist
```
